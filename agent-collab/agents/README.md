# Agents

Each agent keeps a plan, a log, and an inbox/outbox.
Only department reps should post in global coordination logs.

Use templates/ to add new agents or departments.
Copy templates/role/ into agents/<id>/ when creating a new role.

Recommended ID pattern:
- ai/<dept>/rep-01
- human/<name>

Leadership owner:
- agents/human/gong
