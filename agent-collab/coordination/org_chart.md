# Org Chart

Current structure (expand as needed):

- human/gong (Owner)
  - ai/tech-lead/rep-01 (Tech Lead / DRI)
    - ai/backend/rep-01 (Backend Rep)
      - ai/backend/lua-01 (Lua Backend Engineer)
    - ai/frontend/rep-01 (Frontend Rep)

Notes:
- Keep agent IDs stable; if a role is handed over, reuse the same ID.
- Add new departments under the tech lead or split by domain.
